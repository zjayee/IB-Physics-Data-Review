# IB Physics Data Review: An IB Physics Revision App
**[Download on Google Play](tinyurl.com/ibphysicsdatareview)**

From my experience as a IB Physics HL student, I found that the data booklet was an essential tool for exams. Having a thorough understanding of all the formulas was incredibly valuable in achieving my 7 in the course. 

Following this idea, I created the app **IB Physics Data Review**:

>IB Physics Data Review is a condensed overview of the key concepts in IB physics. The app is centered around the data booklet, a valuable resource to understand for exams. The formulas are organized by topic and in chronological order corresponding to the data booklet. For each formula there is an explanation of the symbols and application of the formula. 

I have also included knowledge from my experience of doing several past papers in preparation for exams into the formula explanations. I hope this app can help you in your preparation for IB assessments.
